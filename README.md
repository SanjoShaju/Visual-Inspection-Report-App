This is an android app that I created for ZF WindPower to automate their Visual Inspection Report of their manufactured parts.
The app does the following functions
* - Creates the report in .csv or .pdf format
* - Takes pictures of the fault whenever necessary and saves it along with the pdf file generated.
* - Can send SMS to the required people whenever the inspector comes across an issue.
* - Helps in selecting a location of the part(which is given in a grid format) and enters it in remarks to inform the exact position.
* - Able to share the file genarated in an for i.e. via. mail, whatsapp etc
